### Details

* 2014/10/11, starting 1608
* Air temperature 24.2 celsius, humidity 42%
* Tap water temperature 21.0 celsius
* 2 rolls: [Cinestill b/w xx shot at 200 (35)](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll369&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00) and [Ilford delta 400 (120)](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll372&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00)
* Soaked with tap water (5 minutes) - broke the tank...
* Rodinal (R09) 1:200 (1 liter water + 5ml Rodinal), 2 hours (from 1619 to 1819)
* Stopped with tap water (5 minutes)
* Fixed with Rollei RXN (not RXA) (5 minutes), 900 ml water + 100 ml RXN (10th usage)
* First rinse with a drop of soap dish in the tap water
* Rinsed with tap water, 15 minutes with the tank at 20 degrees, tap water flowing in and out
* Wiped the water with paper

* Paterson PTP116, with 3 PTP119

The water used to soak the negatives came out between blue and purple.

### Problems

The [last development](2014-10-11-stand-dev-9.html) saw the rolls falling out of the tank during soaking. This time I manage to break the tank. I tapped too vigorously to "dislodge the bubbles" and ended up with a 7cm fracture on the side of the tank.

It seems to have leaked light in, and it sure leaked water out. I taped it with strong tape and it was OK.

I didn't notice the fracture at first, but that didn't last, as water was flowing out.


### Considerations

First time developing Cinestill. It came out OK, somewhere between tri-x and acros. I have to find a set of film that is easily available and fits stand development. I have to improve my (snap)shooting too.
