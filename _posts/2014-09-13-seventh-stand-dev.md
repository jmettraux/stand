### Details

* 2014/09/07, starting 1332
* Air temperature 27.1 celsius, humidity 55%
* Tap water temperature 25.0 celsius
* 3 rolls: [Kodak tri-x 400](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll341&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00), [Ilford hp5 plus 400](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll344&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00) and [Ilford delta 400](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll347&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00)
* Soaked with tap water (5 minutes)
* Rodinal (R09) 1:200 (1 liter water + 5ml Rodinal), 2 hours (from 1341 to 1542)
* Stopped with tap water (5 minutes)
* Fixed with Rollei RXN (not RXA) (5 minutes), 900 ml water + 100 ml RXN (7th usage)
* First rinse with a drop of soap dish in the tap water
* Rinsed with tap water, 15 minutes with the tank at 20 degrees, tap water flowing in and out
* Wiped the water with paper

* Paterson PTP116, with 3 PTP119

The water used to soak the negatives came out colorless.

### Problems

The [dots all over](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jmettraux/14875733120/in/photostream/lightbox) problem I had with Ilford hp5 in the last [stand](2014-08-29-sixth-stand-dev.html) came back. I noticed that I shot and stand developed a [roll of hp5](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll292&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00) during [stand 2](2014-07-05-second-stand-dev.html), but had no dots cropping up (the problem was with water marks at that point).

I tried to wipe the water with a squeegee pincer thing but it was difficult, not smooth at all. I went back to wiping with paper.

### Considerations

I will go on trying with hp5. I need to shoot with acros 100 (one roll coming in 6x6 for the next stand).

Not many public photos for this batch, lots of them are "family" and the rest is not good (I should say "the rest is not passable").
