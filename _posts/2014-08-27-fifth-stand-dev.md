### Details

* 2014/08/26, starting 2045
* Air temperature 28.4 celsius, humidity 55%
* Tap water temperature 25.0 celsius
* 2 rolls: [35mm Fuji neopan acros 100](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll315&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00) and [120 Fuji neopan acros 100](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll338&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00)
* Soaked with tap water (from 2045 to 2050)

* Stopped with tap water (5 minutes)
* Fixed with Rollei RXN (not RXA) (5 minutes), 900 ml water + 100 ml RXN (5th usage)
* First rinse with a drop of soap dish in the tap water
* Rinsed with tap water, 15 minutes with the tank at 20 degrees, tap water flowing in and out
* Wiped the water with one of those gum thinggy, and then some fat cleaning paper

* Paterson PTP116, with 3 PTP119

The water used to soak the negatives came out blue, tabular film...

### Problems

None.

### Considerations

I wiped carefully the films after the final rinse. It helped a lot, no more water marks. In order to simplify that, I ordered a [film wiper](http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B001WAJUH6/), I hope it'll prove useful.

I noticed I forget to "tap the tank to remove the bubbles" when agitating. Seems ok without it, but I'll try not to forget next time.
