### Details

* Air temperature 28 celsius.
* 3 rolls: [tri-x](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll280&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00), [acros](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll288&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00) and [presto](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll289&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00), all 35mm.
* Soaked with tap water.
* Rodinal (R09) 1:200 (1 liter water + 5ml Rodinal), 2 hours (from 1928 to 2128).
* Stopped with tap water.
* Fixed with Rollei RXN (not RXA), 900 ml water + 100 ml RXN.
* Rinsed with tap water.
* wiped the water with one of those gum thinggy.

* Paterson PTP116, with 3 PTP119. Yes, plastic.

### Problems

* I had troubles inserting the very first film while in the changing bag. It resulted in a few inelegant folds on the film, but nothing serious.
* I tried to insert the film (presto) in its shortage sheet a bit early, it was not entirely dry. Somehow the storage plastic got stained and sticky. I threw it away an inserted the film in a new sheet when it got really dry.

### Considerations

It's my first stand dev. It's my first time doing development as well. I'm trying with this minimalistic way of developping, hoping it'll yield decent results.

Happy with the output. Looking forward to the next iteration.
