title: first stand dev
---

* Air temperature 28 celsius.
* 3 rolls : tri-x, acros and presto.
* Soaked with tap water.
* Rodinal (R09) 1:200 (1 liter water + 5ml Rodinal), 2 hours (from 1928 to 2128).
* Stopped with tap water.
* Fixed with Rollei RXN (not RXA), 900 ml water + 100 ml RXN.
* Rinsed with tap water.

It's my first stand dev. It's my first time doing development as well. I'm trying with this minimalistic way of doing, hoping it'll yield decent results.
