### Details

* 2014/07/13, starting 1951
* Air temperature 26.6 celsius, humidity 75%.
* 3 rolls: [35mm Kodak Tri-x](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll297&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00), [35mm Fuji Presto](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll298&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00) and another [35mm Kodak Tri-x](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll300&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00).
* Soaked with tap water (from 1958 to 2003).
* Rodinal (R09) 1:200 (1 liter water + 5ml Rodinal), 2 hours (from 2006 to 2206).
* Stopped with tap water (5 minutes).
* Fixed with Rollei RXN (not RXA) (5 minutes), 900 ml water + 100 ml RXN (3rd usage).
* Rinsed with tap water.
* Wiped the water with one of those gum thinggy.

* Paterson PTP116, with 3 PTP119.

The water used to soak the negatives came out colorless (no HP5 this time, I guess).

### Problems

* More stickiness problems, could be a lack of drying, especially with 60% to 75% humidity, but I discussed my recipe with [Tony](http://tg.lambda.io) and he explained to me how he rinsed. I only rinse for 5 minutes, he rinses for 20 minutes, tank inclined with a gentle water flow. I'm going to follow his advice for the next stand dev. I hope that a careful rinsing will make the sticky stuff on the emulsion side go away.
* Another trick from Tony: a tiny drop of dish cleaning product in the initial rinse water. I've seen this trick given countless times, always mentioning the product names (Tony was recommending something like "froggy", can't remember the exact name). I'll do with whatever I use to clean the dishes at home.

### Considerations

Starting to wonder if shouldn't set my meters to 800 when shooting 400, more black, less grey.

I want to try to hang my negatives diagonally as well. It seems like a lot of people do it. I haven't had water marks this time, but it looks like an easy way to prevent (some of) them.
