### Details

* 2014/11/02, starting 1412
* Air temperature 24.0 celsius, humidity 63%
* Tap water temperature 20.5 celsius
* 2 rolls: [Ilford hp5 400 (120)](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll387&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00) and [Kodak 400 tmax (35)](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll388&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00)
* Soaked with tap water (5 minutes)
* Rodinal (R09) 1:200 (1 liter water + 5ml Rodinal), 2 hours (from 1424 to 1624)
* Stopped with tap water (5 minutes)
* Fixed with Rollei RXN (not RXA) (5 minutes), 900 ml water + 100 ml RXN (13th usage)
* First rinse with a drop of soap dish in the tap water
* Rinsed with tap water, 15 minutes with the tank at 20 degrees, tap water flowing in and out
* Wiped the water with paper

* Paterson PTP116, with 3 PTP119

The water used to soak the negatives came out violet.

### Problems

A small light leak occured when manipulating the 120 film in the dark bag. Only one photo lost.


### Considerations

The tmax is nice. I picked up 5 rolls in 120, I'm looking forward to see what comes out of it.

Tap water is getting colder, I'm wondering what impact it'll have on the results.
