### Details

* 2014/08/25, starting 2037
* Air temperature 28.5 celsius, humidity 61%
* Tap water temperature 28.0 celsius
* 2 rolls: [35mm Kodak tmax 100](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll310&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00) and [120 Kodak tri-x 400](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll319&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00)
* Soaked with tap water (from 2045 to 2052)
* Rodinal (R09) 1:200 (1 liter water + 5ml Rodinal), 2 hours (from 2052 to 2253)
* Stopped with tap water (5 minutes)
* Fixed with Rollei RXN (not RXA) (5 minutes), 900 ml water + 100 ml RXN (3rd usage)
* First rinse with a drop of soap dish in the tap water
* Rinsed with tap water, 15 minutes with the tank at 20 degrees, tap water flowing in and out
* Wiped the water with one of those gum thinggy

* Paterson PTP116, with 3 PTP119.

The water used to soak the negatives came out blue, probably the tabular Kodak tmax.

### Problems

* a few watermarks ([top left](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jmettraux/15019076576/)) on the 35mm film, I'll need to carefully  wipe the water away after the rinse job
* Not a development problem, but a scanning problem. [Tony](http://tg.lambda.io) mentioned that my 35mm scans looked blurry, he attributes the problem to my flatbed scanner, it might be fancy, be it can't beat a dedicated 35mm film scanner

### Considerations

I think I'm getting the hand of the technique. Still need a lot of practice but I like it a lot. I can make incremental changes, hopefully each in the right direction.
