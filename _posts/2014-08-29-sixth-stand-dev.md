### Details

* 2014/08/27, starting 2032
* Air temperature 28.1 celsius, humidity 55%
* Tap water temperature 26.0 celsius
* 3 rolls: [Kodak tmax 400](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll340&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00), [Kodak tri-x 400](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll339&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00) and [Ilford hp5 plus 400](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll336&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00)
* Soaked with tap water (5 minutes)
* Rodinal (R09) 1:200 (1 liter water + 5ml Rodinal), 2 hours (from 2041 to 2252)
* Stopped with tap water (5 minutes)
* Fixed with Rollei RXN (not RXA) (5 minutes), 900 ml water + 100 ml RXN (6th usage)
* First rinse with a drop of soap dish in the tap water
* Rinsed with tap water, 15 minutes with the tank at 20 degrees, tap water flowing in and out
* Wiped the water with one of those gum thinggy, and then some fat cleaning paper

* Paterson PTP116, with 3 PTP119

The water used to soak the negatives came out colorless, but there were bubbles (I tapped 2-3 times after the five agitations set, that's the cause, maybe).

### Problems

The tmax and the tri-x came out OK. The Ilford hp5 has [dots all over](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jmettraux/14875733120/in/photostream/lightbox). I wonder if it's my final wiping with kitchen paper (but these are dots, not scratches...). Maybe it's because I wrote the R336 on the start of the film with a permanent marker... Well, no, the other films are not affected.

### Considerations

A bit disappointed with the Ilford hp5. I'll order a box or two to see if it happens again.

I think I like tmax, although I think I prefer acros 100. We'll see.
