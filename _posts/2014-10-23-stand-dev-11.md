* Air temperature 22.1 celsius, humidity 53%
* Tap water temperature 22.0 celsius
* 2 rolls: [Cinestill b/w xx shot at 200 (35)](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll371&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00) and [Kodak tri-x 400 (120)](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll374&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00)
* Soaked with tap water (5 minutes)
* Rodinal (R09) 1:200 (1 liter water + 5ml Rodinal), 2 hours (from 1307 to 1507)
* Stopped with tap water (5 minutes)
* Fixed with Rollei RXN (not RXA) (5 minutes), 900 ml water + 100 ml RXN (11th usage)
* First rinse with a drop of soap dish in the tap water
* Rinsed with tap water, 15 minutes with the tank at 20 degrees, tap water flowing in and out
* Wiped the water with paper

* Paterson PTP116, with 3 PTP119

The water used to soak the negatives came out between turquoise.

### Problems

Have had no problems. The taped tank seems to hold well.


### Considerations

Liking Cinestill bw (especially the pictures from the [previous stand](2014-10-11-stand-dev-10.html)), too bad it's not available in stores here.
