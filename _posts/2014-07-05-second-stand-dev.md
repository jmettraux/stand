### Details

(next time, I'll have to measure the temperature of the tap water)

* 2014/07/03 from 2113
* Air temperature 26 celsius, humidity 75%.
* 2 rolls: [120 Fuji Acros](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll296&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00) and [Ilford HP5](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll292&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00).
* Soaked with tap water.
* Rodinal (R09) 1:200 (1 liter water + 5ml Rodinal), 2 hours (from 2121 to 2321).
* Stopped with tap water.
* Fixed with Rollei RXN (not RXA), 900 ml water + 100 ml RXN (2nd usage).
* Rinsed with tap water.
* Wiped the water with one of those gum thinggy.

* Paterson PTP116, with 3 PTP119.

The water used to soak the negatives came out "royal blue". I wonder if it's the HP5. I can't remember what color it was on the [first stand](2014-06-15-first-stand-dev.html).

### Problems

* Inserting the 120 film was difficult, resulting in a stress mark on the first frame. Maybe a simpler, non Paterson-autoload reel, is easier to load...
* I had lots of "water marks", I only noticed them during scanning (like in [this picture](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jmettraux/14390035138/in/photostream/lightbox/)), wiping the negative makes them go away.
* There was something sticky left on one frame, the scan came out [bad](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jmettraux/14576663675/in/photostream/lightbox/), but anyway...

### Considerations

I'm a bit less enthusiastic than the first time, but it's not the stand itself, it's rather my pictures that are poorly exposed... Well, I'm just a snapshooter.

The medium format roll ([roll 296](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll296&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00)) is mostly an initial exploration of "pictorial lighting", but that's for an upcoming post.
