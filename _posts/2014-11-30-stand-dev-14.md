### Details

* 2014/11/07, starting 1727
* Air temperature 23.2 celsius, humidity 48%
* Tap water temperature 16.0 celsius
* 2 rolls: [Shangai gp3 100 (120)](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll391&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00) and [Fuji acros 100 (35)](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll388&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00)
* Soaked with tap water (5 minutes)
* Rodinal (R09) 1:200 (1 liter water + 5ml Rodinal), 2 hours (from 1735 to 1939)
* Stopped with tap water (5 minutes)
* Fixed with Rollei RXN (not RXA) (5 minutes), 900 ml water + 100 ml RXN (14th usage)
* First rinse with a drop of soap dish in the tap water
* Rinsed with tap water, 15 minutes with the tank at 20 degrees, tap water flowing in and out
* Wiped the water with paper

* Paterson PTP116, with 3 PTP119

The water used to soak the negatives came out blue.

### Problems

The Shangai gp3 seems to be "load and unload in <strike>subdued light</strike>the dark". The dots printed on the paper nicely intercepted light and were thus reproduced. The price is slighty cheaper than Fuji acros 100 so I'd better stick with acros.

### Considerations

I should shoot more.
