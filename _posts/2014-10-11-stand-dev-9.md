### Details

* 2014/09/28, starting 1708
* Air temperature 27.7 celsius, humidity 44%
* Tap water temperature 23.0 celsius
* 3 rolls: [Fuji neopan acros 100 (35)](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll358&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00), [Ilford panf plus 50 (35)](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll362&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00) and [Fuji neopan acros 100 (35)](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=roll363&sort=date-posted-desc&user_id=48024574%40N00)
* Soaked with tap water (5 minutes)
* Rodinal (R09) 1:200 (1 liter water + 5ml Rodinal), 2 hours (from 1720 to 1920)
* Stopped with tap water (5 minutes)
* Fixed with Rollei RXN (not RXA) (5 minutes), 900 ml water + 100 ml RXN (9th usage)
* First rinse with a drop of soap dish in the tap water
* Rinsed with tap water, 15 minutes with the tank at 20 degrees, tap water flowing in and out
* Wiped the water with paper

* Paterson PTP116, with 3 PTP119

The water used to soak the negatives came out colorless.

### Problems

After the soaking, while emptying the tank, the top came out and the rolls with it... Exposure. I quickly put everything back in (including some pieces of vegetables that were at the bottom of the sink) and went on. 4 or 5 frames per rolls were "exposed", but the rest came out, well, ok.

No thinking, just reacting. Put everything back in and go on. I hope it won't happen again, especially not with a roll of 120 in.

I have to check the top lock before each pouring operations.

### Considerations

The rolls falling accident somehow ruined some of the frames, but hey, it's home dev... I think it adds some "cachet" to the images.
